In Django, static files are the non-dynamic assets that are essential for the front-end of a web application. These files are typically served directly to the client's browser without any server-side processing.
Common examples of static files include: 
CSS files: These define the visual styling and layout of web pages, controlling elements like fonts, colors, and spacing.
JavaScript files: These add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages, such as form validation, animations, and content updates.
Images: Graphics, photos, and icons used to enhance the visual appeal and user experience.
Fonts: Custom typefaces used for branding or design purposes.


Open the templates/template.html file and add the following:
{% load static %}
And:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'myfirst.css' %}">


example.html

{% load static %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'myfirst.css' %}">
<body>

{% for x in fruits %}
  <h1>{{ x }}</h1>
{% endfor %}

</body>
</html>
