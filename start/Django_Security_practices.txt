1. Use HTTPS Everywhere

Enforce HTTPS in your Django settings by setting SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True to ensure all traffic is encrypted.

2. Keep Django and Dependencies Updated

Always keep Django and third-party libraries up to date to mitigate vulnerabilities. Use pip to install updates and stay current with security patches.

3. Enable CSRF Protection

Django includes Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection by default. Ensure it's enabled (CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True for HTTPS) and use {% csrf_token %} in your forms.

4. Set Secure Cookies

Set cookies to be secure and HttpOnly to protect against client-side attacks.

CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True

5. Use Strong Password Hashing

Django uses PBKDF2 for password hashing by default, but you can use stronger algorithms like Argon2 by setting:

PASSWORD_HASHERS = ['django.contrib.auth.hashers.Argon2PasswordHasher']

6. Limit User Permissions

Use Django’s built-in permissions and groups to limit access to views and actions for different users. Avoid using overly permissive roles.

7. Use Django’s Security Middleware

Enable security middleware like SecurityMiddleware in your MIDDLEWARE settings to add additional layers of protection:

MIDDLEWARE = [
    'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
    # Other middleware entries
]

8. Set Content Security Policy (CSP)

To prevent XSS and other attacks, use Django's django-csp middleware to enforce a Content Security Policy:

CSP_DEFAULT_SRC = ("'self'",)

9. Sanitize User Input

Always validate and sanitize any input from users. Django’s form validation and model field validators are helpful, but consider using libraries like bleach for HTML sanitization.

10. Disable Debug Mode in Production

Never deploy Django with DEBUG = True in production as it exposes detailed error messages. Always set DEBUG = False and use proper logging.

11. Set a Strong Secret Key

Ensure that your SECRET_KEY is long, random, and kept private. Avoid using weak or predictable keys.

12. Restrict Allowed Hosts

Set ALLOWED_HOSTS to a list of valid domain names/IP addresses for your site:

ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['yourdomain.com', 'www.yourdomain.com']

13. Use Django’s Rate Limiting

Implement rate-limiting using middleware or tools like django-ratelimit to prevent brute-force attacks.

14. Enable Database Security

Protect your database credentials and restrict user permissions. Use DATABASES settings with secure credentials management, and limit database user privileges.

15. Backup Regularly

Regularly back up your data to prevent data loss in case of a breach or attack.

16. Use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Implement 2FA for sensitive accounts, like admins, using packages like django-otp or django-two-factor-auth.

17. Use Django’s Clickjacking Protection

Enable clickjacking protection using:

X_FRAME_OPTIONS = 'DENY'

18. Limit Exposure of Sensitive Information

Avoid exposing sensitive information like database credentials, secret keys, or API keys in your codebase. Use environment variables or a secure vault service.
