Purpose of requirements.txt

1.Dependency Management
It keeps track of all the Python packages your project depends on.
For example, if your project uses numpy, pandas, and flask, you can record them in requirements.txt.
2.Easy Environment Setup
Anyone (including you on another computer) can recreate the same environment by running:
pip install -r requirements.txt
This installs all the required packages with the correct versions.
3.Version Control
You can pin exact versions to avoid compatibility issues:
numpy==1.26.0
pandas==2.2.0
flask==3.0.2
This ensures your project works consistently across systems.
4.Collaboration
When you share your project (e.g., on GitHub), others can set up their environment easily without guessing dependencies.
